# Server Requirements
::lead-p
Spin gives you the power to choose any host that you want. Although the responsibility is on your shoulders to get a server set up, Spin makes it very easy to get this accomplished.
::

## Choose a host
We've run [VPS Benchmarks against a number of hosts](https://521dimensions.notion.site/VPS-Benchmarks-for-Self-hosters-c6eca7c5f16d4bb8aeb989174fc58ffe?pvs=4) and have found the following hosts to have great value. The links below are referral links, meaning we get a small kickback if you sign up -- but this doesn't affect our recommendations.

### Hetzner
Hetzner is a German-based company with data centers in the EU and the US. Their pricing is very competitive and they have incredible performance.

With the link below, they offer €⁠20 (~$21 USD) credits free which can get you a server for a few months.

### Any other host
Spin is host-agnostic, meaning you can run Spin anywhere. If you have a preferred host, you can use them as well. Just make sure that your host meets the following requirements below.

## Recommended Server Specs
::note
It is best to run `spin provision` against a **brand new server** with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04 or newer. This will ensure that the server is in a known state and that the configuration will work as expected.
::

Hardware specs largely depend on your project, but even for simple apps, we recommend the following:

- **CPU**: 1 CPU core
- **RAM**: 1GB
- **Storage**: >25GB SSD
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (64-bit) [[request ARM64 support](https://github.com/serversideup/spin/discussions/9)]
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer
- **Snapshots/Backups**: Highly recommended
- **Firewall**: Configured to allow SSH and HTTPS traffic (22/tcp, 80/tcp, 443/tcp)
- **Access**: Root SSH access
