# Testing New Releases
::lead-p
Spin is a collection of many open source projects built by the Server Side Up community. If you're looking for the latest features, here is how you can help test them out.
::

## Installing latest Spin beta release
Spin is very lightweight and is installed to your `~/.spin` directory by default. If you'd like to install the latest beta, we can easily 

::code-panel
---
label: Install latest Spin beta release
---
```bash
# Ensure previous installation is removed
rm -rf ~/.spin

# Install the latest release (regardless of pre-release or stable)
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)" "" --beta
```
::

## Going back to the stable release
Going back to the stable release is as easy as deleting the `~/.spin` directory then following the installation instructions to reinstall Spin.

::code-panel
---
label: Delete the ~/.spin directory
---
```bash
rm -rf ~/.spin
```
::

Now follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

- [Install to macOS](/docs/installation/install-macos)
- [Install to Linux](/docs/installation/install-linux)
- [Install to Windows](/docs/installation/install-windows)
