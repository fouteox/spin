# Add Spin to an Existing Project
::lead-p
Adding Spin to an existing project is easy. Everything works through the `spin init` command, we'll ask you a few questions, then you'll be on your way to shipping a 100% replicated application.
::

## Install Spin
We have a number of ways to install Spin. Pick any one.

- [Install to macOS](/docs/installation/install-macos/)
- [Install to Windows](/docs/installation/install-windows)
- [Install to Linux](/docs/installation/install-linux)
- [Install via Composer](/docs/installation/install-composer)
- [Install via NPM/Yarn](/docs/installation/install-npm-yarn)

::note
Moving forward, this guide assumes you configured `spin` as an alias or installed it locally on your machine.
::

## Initialize Spin
Run this command in the root of your project:

::code-panel
---
label: "Initialize Spin"
---
```bash
spin init <template-name>
```
::

You need to replace `<template-name>` with the name of the template you want to use. Look under "Project Templates" in the sidebar/navigation to see the available templates.

## Important things to know
Each template will have its own special `init` process. Be sure to refer to the project's README file for any steps required after adding Spin to your project.
