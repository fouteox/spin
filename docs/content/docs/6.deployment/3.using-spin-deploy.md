# Using "spin deploy"
::lead-p
The `spin deploy` command is the easiest way to deploy your application without downtime while avoiding the complexities of learning CI/CD or GitHub Actions. 
::

## When "spin deploy" is the right choice
We created `spin deploy` for the solo developer who wants an easy way to quickly deploy their application without the burden of learning CI/CD or GitHub Actions. If you're on a larger team or share your application with many developers, we highly recommend coming up with an [automated deployment strategy](/docs/deployment/automated-deployments-with-github-actions).

## How "spin deploy" works
It's quite brilliant how `spin deploy` works. When you run this command, it will build your application locally with Docker, upload it to a temporary registry running on your machine, establish an SSH tunnel to your server, then have your server pull the new image from your local machine without any downtime.

All of this is completed in one command without you needing to know how to configure Docker registries, CI/CD tools, or anything else. ðŸ¤¯
