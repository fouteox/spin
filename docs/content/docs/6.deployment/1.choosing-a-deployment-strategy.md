# Choosing a Deployment Strategy
::lead-p
Spin supports automated deployments and very simple deployments from your local machine. You can choose between these two strategies depending on your needs.
::

## Types of Deployments
There are two types of deployments:

1. **Automated Deployments** - You can use our GitHub Actions to help you automatically deploy your application when you push to GitHub.
2. **Simple Deployments from your local machine** - We can use the [`spin deploy`](/docs/command-reference/deploy) command to deploy your application from your local machine to your server.

Automated deployments are recommended for teams because they standardize the deployment process without human interaction. If you're a solo developer, you may find that [`spin deploy`](/docs/command-reference/deploy) is so easy to use you'll never need to learn the complexities of CI/CD or GitHub Actions.

## Automated Deployments with GitHub Actions
