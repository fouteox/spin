# Create a Server with Hetzner
::lead-p
Hetzner is a German-based company with data centers in the EU and the US. Their pricing is very competitive and they have incredible performance.
::

## Create an account
The first step is to create an account with Hetzner. You can do this by going to their website and clicking the "Sign Up" button. With the link below, they offer ‚Ç¨‚Å†20 (~$21 USD) credits free which can get you a server for a few months. This is an affiliate link, meaning we get a small kickback if you sign up, but this doesn't affect our recommendations.

## Create an API token
To create an API token, you'll need to sign in to the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/). Once signed in, select your project.

![Select Hetzner Project](/images/docs/hetzner/select-project.png)

Inside of the project, look for the "Security" page on the left, then click "API Tokens" at the top.

![Hetzner API Tokens](/images/docs/hetzner/api-token-page.png)

When you click "Generate API Token", you'll be presented with the option to select the scopes for the token. Select "Read & Write".

![Hetzner API Token Scopes](/images/docs/hetzner/generate-token.png)

::note
This API token is very powerful and should be treated as a secret. Do not share this token and treat it like you would a password.
::

## Place the token in your `.spin.yml` file
In your `.spin.yml` file, you'll find a `providers` section where you can add your Hetzner API token.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml configure providers
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# üëá Providers - You must set at least one provider
##############################################################

providers:
  - name: hetzner
    api_token: abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
```
::

## Set as HCLOUD_TOKEN environment variable
If you prefer to set the token as an environment variable, you can also set the `HCLOUD_TOKEN` variable in your `.env` file, secrets manager, or wherever you store your environment variables.

## Configure users
Make sure you configure your system users in your `.spin.yml` file.

::code-panel
---
label: Example users configuration in .spin.yml
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# üëá Users - You must set at least one user
##############################################################

users:
  - username: alice
    name: Alice Smith
    groups: ['sudo']
    authorized_keys:
      - public_key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lmyfakeublickeyMVIzwQXBzxxD9b8Erd1FKVvu alice"
```

## Configuring a Hetzner hardware profile
By default we set you up with a very cost-effective hardware profile to get up and running quickly.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml default Hardware Profiles
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# ü§ñ Hardware Profiles
##############################################################

hardware_profiles:
  # Hetzner
  - name: hetzner_2c_2gb_ubuntu2404
    provider: hetzner
    profile_config:
      location: ash
      server_type: cpx11
      image: ubuntu-24.04

## Provision your server
Once you have everything ready, you can provision your server(s) by running this simple command:

::code-panel
---
label: Provision your server(s)
---
```bash
spin provision
```
::

This command will create your server(s) with Hetzner and configure your server(s) to be ready for deployment. There are many more options available when provisioning your server(s). To learn more see the guide below:
