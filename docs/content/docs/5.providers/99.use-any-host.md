# Use Any Host with Spin
::lead-p
Spin supports any host that supports running Ubuntu 22.04 or newer. As long as your host allows you to run a server with the Spin Server Requirements, it will work with Spin. This includes running servers on a major cloud provider down to an old computer running in your grandmother's basement ü§†.
::

## Server Requirements
Make sure your server and host meet the minimum server requirements.

[View the Spin Server Requirements ‚Üí](/docs/server-configuration/server-requirements)

## Ensure you're able to connect to your server via SSH
Since you'll have to take care of the set up manually, ensure you can connect to your server via SSH.

::code-panel
---
label: 'Confirm SSH access'
---
```bash
# Replace 1.2.3.4 with your server's IP address
ssh root@1.2.3.4
```
::

## Configure users
Make sure you configure your system users in your `.spin.yml` file.

[Learn more about users ‚Üí](/docs/server-configuration/spin-yml-usage#users)

::code-panel
---
label: Example users configuration in .spin.yml
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# üëá Users - You must set at least one user
##############################################################

users:
  - username: alice
    name: Alice Smith
    groups: ['sudo']
    authorized_keys:
      - public_key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lmyfakeublickeyMVIzwQXBzxxD9b8Erd1FKVvu alice"
```
::

## You can remove "providers" and "hardware_profiles" if you want
By default, the `.spin.yml` file includes some defaults for providers and hardware profiles. You can remove these if you want to use your own.

::code-panel
---
label: '‚ùå You can remove these lines if you want'
---
```yaml
# ##############################################################
# # üëá Providers - You must set at least one provider
# ##############################################################

# providers:
#   - name: digitalocean
#     api_token: Set token here OR delete this line and set environment variable DO_API_TOKEN

#   - name: hetzner
#     api_token: Set token here OR delete this line and set environment variable HCLOUD_TOKEN

#   - name: vultr
#     api_token: Set token here OR delete this line and set environment variable VULTR_API_KEY

# ##############################################################
# # üëá Servers - You must set at least one server
# ##############################################################

# servers:
#   - server_name: ubuntu-2gb-ash-1
#     environment: production
#     hardware_profile: hetzner_2c_2gb_ubuntu2404

#   - server_name: ubuntu-1gb-ord-2
#     environment: staging
#     hardware_profile: vultr_1c_1gb_ubuntu2404
```
::

## Set your server address under "servers"
If you use our native providers with Spin, it will automatically create and populate the `address` property for you. Since in this case we're providing our own server, we'll need to set the `address` property for the server in the `.spin.yml` file.

::code-panel
---
label: '.spin.yml'
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# üëá Servers - You must set at least one server
##############################################################

servers:
  - server_name: my-awesome-server
    environment: production
    address: 1.2.3.4 # üëà Be sure to set this to your server's IP address or DNS hostname
    # hardware_profile: hetzner_2c_2gb_ubuntu2404 (‚ùå You can comment or delete this line out)
```
::

You can use the IP address or hostname of your server. Feel free to remove the `hardware_profile` property if you do not plan to use any providers.

## Provision your server
Once you have everything ready, you can provision your server(s) with the following command:

::code-panel
---
label: Provision your server(s)
---
```bash
spin provision -u root
```
::

::note
‚ö†Ô∏è Most cloud providers (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner) use `root` as the default user. If your server uses a different sudo user, replace `root` with that username.
::

To learn more about this process, see the guide below:

[Learn more about "spin provision" ‚Üí](/docs/command-reference/provision)

### Troubleshooting SSH Connection
If you encounter connection issues, verify your SSH access first:

::code-panel
---
label: Verify SSH access
---
```bash
ssh root@1.2.3.4  # Replace with your username and server IP
```
::

You should be able to connect using SSH key authentication without being prompted for a password.

## Getting ready for deployment
Now that you have a server ready, you'll want to learn how to get ready for deployment. Next steps are to choose a deployment strategy.
