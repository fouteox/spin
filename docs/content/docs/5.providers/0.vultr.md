# Create a Server with Vultr
::lead-p
Vultr is a US-based company that has a great reputation for performance and value. They have a wide range of data centers around the world and a great API for automation.
::

## Create an account
The first step is to create an account with Vultr. You can do this by going to their website and clicking the "Sign Up" button. With the link below, they offer $100 in credits. This is an affiliate link, meaning we get a small kickback if you sign up, but this doesn't affect our recommendations.

## Create an API token
::note
This API token is very powerful and should be treated as a secret. Do not share this token and treat it like you would a password.
::

To create an API token, you'll need to sign in to the [Vultr Console](https://my.vultr.com/). Click on your name in the upper right, then click "API".

![Go to Vultr API](/images/docs/vultr/api-link.png)

On the API page, click the "Enable API" button.

![Enable Vultr API](/images/docs/vultr/enable-api.png)

You'll see your API token on the page. Press the "Copy" button to copy the token to your clipboard.

::note
This token is like a password that has full access to your account. If you want to limit the API key by IP address, you can do so by adjusting the "Access Control" settings on the API page.
::


## Place the token in your `.spin.yml` file
In your `.spin.yml` file, you'll find a `providers` section where you can add your Vultr API token.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml configure providers
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# ðŸ‘‡ Providers - You must set at least one provider
##############################################################

providers:
  - name: vultr
    api_token: abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
```
::

## Set as VULTR_API_KEY environment variable
If you prefer to set the token as an environment variable, you can also set the `VULTR_API_KEY` variable in your `.env` file, secrets manager, or wherever you store your environment variables.

## Configure users
Make sure you configure your system users in your `.spin.yml` file.

::code-panel
---
label: Example users configuration in .spin.yml
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# ðŸ‘‡ Users - You must set at least one user
##############################################################

users:
  - username: alice
    name: Alice Smith
    groups: ['sudo']
    authorized_keys:
      - public_key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lmyfakeublickeyMVIzwQXBzxxD9b8Erd1FKVvu alice"
```
::

## Configuring a Vultr hardware profile
By default we set you up with a very cost-effective hardware profile to get up and running quickly.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml default Hardware Profiles
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# ðŸ¤– Hardware Profiles
##############################################################

hardware_profiles:
  # Vultr
  - name: vultr_1c_1gb_ubuntu2404
    provider: vultr
    profile_config:
      region: ord
      plan: vc2-1c-1gb
      os: "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x64"
      backups: true
```
::

You can uncomment the defaults we give you or create/modify your own hardware profile.

## Provision your server
Once you have everything ready, you can provision your server(s) by running this simple command:

::code-panel
---
label: Provision your server(s)
---
```bash
spin provision
```
::

This command will create your server(s) with Vultr and configure your server(s) to be ready for deployment. There are many more options available when provisioning your server(s). To learn more see the guide below:

## Getting ready for deployment
Now that you have a server ready, you'll want to learn how to get ready for deployment. Next steps are to choose a deployment strategy.
