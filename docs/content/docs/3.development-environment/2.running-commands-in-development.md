# Running Commands in Development
::lead-p
Spin makes it easy to run commands in your development environment by following the Docker Compose CLI syntax.
::

## How to run commands in development
You have two options to run commands in your development environment:

1. [`spin exec`](/docs/command-reference/exec) - This executes commands in an EXISTING container (and requires that service to be already running with `spin up`).
2. [`spin run`](/docs/command-reference/run) - This executes commands in a NEW container, then exits.

For example, let's say you want to run `composer install` in your development environment for Laravel, you would use the following command:

::note
If you have `spin up` running in a terminal window, you will need to run the `spin run` or `spin exec` command in a new terminal window from your project directory.
::

::code-panel
---
label: Run a command in a new container
---
```bash
# Usage: spin run <service> <command>
spin run php composer install
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Execute a command in an existing container
---
```bash
# Usage: spin exec <service> <command>
spin exec php composer install
```
::

Take note of the syntax. You specify the service you want to run the command in, then the command you want to run. The same is true for `spin exec`.

## When to use `spin exec` vs `spin run`
In development, it's often easier to use `spin run` because it will create a new container and then exit. This is faster than having to start the container with `spin up` and then use `spin exec`.

If you have something that you specifically need to run in an already running container, then you should use `spin exec`.
